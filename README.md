# Get-There

**An app designed to streamline carpooling and take more cars off the road, one vehicle
at a time.**

----

You're a high school student at PHS. You don't have a car, or maybe it's in the shop for
the day. You forgot to schedule a ride with your friends or your mom, though, so now you're
stuck. There's a chance you can bum a ride off of whatever friends haven't already left,
but you know either way you're in a jam. So you pull out your phone, open up the Get-There
app, and find that there's someone leaving the high school in the next five minutes, and
you both agree to a car pool.

You're a high school student at PHS. There's rarely a day where you don't drive yourself to
school in your car, but you always feel like a hypocrite for supporting lower carbon emissions
but not taking any action yourself. You wouldn't mind driving other people to school, 
especially if they were close by; you think it would make the commute more interesting. So
one day you finally download the Get-There app, and post your schedule. By the end of the
next day, you have your three remaining car seats filled, all with people from
your same hill of town, and a week later you have found music you all like and jam out.

You're a high school student at PHS. You had a ride planned with one of your friends, but
your schedule changed. Now you have to stay an extra hour after school. You're worried
about your Get-There carpool, and don't want to stand up your ride, but relax once you
remember you can just automatically drop out of a planned car pool, change your Get-There
schedule to reflect your current schedule, and check for any matches within your time frame.
